### What does SmoothUsers do?
SmoothUsers is a straightforward plugin designed to facilitate more seamless management of players in cross-server gamemodes. Additionally, SmoothUsers automatically manages nickname changes, ensuring a perfect experience.

### Example of a use case
Consider a cross-server survival scenario with two servers: Server A and Server B. In this situation, Player A is located on Server A, while Player B is on Server B. Suppose Player B wishes to invite Player A to their clan using the command "/clan invite username". However, there's a challenge if Player A has never previously joined Server B. As a result, utilizing the "Bukkit.getPlayer(username)" function is not feasible.
In this situation, obtaining the UUID of Player A becomes necessary. Unfortunately, you only have Player A's nickname, and there might be a discrepancy in the letter casing. This is where the SmoothUsers plugin becomes useful â€“ it allows you to overcome this issue and obtain the UUID of Player A.
